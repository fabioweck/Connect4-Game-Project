# Connect4-Game-Project

Object-Oriented practice.

Connect Four is a two-player connection game in which the players first choose a symbol/color and then take turns dropping one Symbol/colored disc 
from the top into a seven-column, six-row vertically suspended grid. The pieces fall straight down, occupying the lowest available space within the column. 
The objective of the game is to be the first to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of four of one's own symbols/colored discs.
